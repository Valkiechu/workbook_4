              <p class="para1" align="center">
                Pittsburgh is a vibrant city located in western Pennsylvania, known for
                its history, <br> cultural diversity, and natural beauty. <br> The city was
                founded in the 18th century and played a significant role in the <br>
                industrial revolution, becoming a major center for steel production and <br>
                manufacturing. Today, Pittsburgh has evolved into a modern metropolis <br>
                with a thriving economy, bustling neighborhoods, and a rich cultural <br>
                scene. Visitors to Pittsburgh can explore its many museums, galleries, <br>
                and theaters, as well as enjoy its famous sports teams, world-class <br>
                restaurants, and stunning views of the city's three rivers. <br>
              </p>
              <p class="para2" align="center">
                Pittsburgh is also known for its stunning architecture and green spaces. <br>
                The city is home to several iconic landmarks, including the PPG Place, <br>
                the Cathedral of Learning, and the Andy Warhol Museum. The city's many <br>
                parks and outdoor recreational areas, including the Schenley Park, Point <br>
                State Park, and the Allegheny Cemetery, provide ample opportunities for <br>
                hiking, biking, and picnicking. Pittsburgh's location near the <br>
                Appalachian Mountains and its proximity to other major cities in the <br>
                region, such as Cleveland and Philadelphia, make it an ideal destination <br>
                for travelers looking to explore the best of the American Northeast. <br>
